#### Response Codes

- **200 OK** for when the API call succeeds
- **400 BAD REQUEST** for when the API call fails due to improper parameters
- **401 UNAUTHORIZED** for when the API fails due to improper authentication
- **500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR** for when something goes wrong - should not be thrown.

Ideally I would have more descriptive error messages given more time.
